Firstly, make sure you're set up and good to go.

    $ bundle
    $ bundle exec rake db:migrate db:test:prepare
    $ bundle exec rspec

If you want to play around, run the server:

    $ bundle exec rails server

If you're using OS X or linux, you can replace `bundle exec command` with `bin/command` for the instructions above.
